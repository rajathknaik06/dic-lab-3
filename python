""" Shruthi is planning her monthly expenses and allocates a certain amount (an integer) to different categories like food, transport, grocery, rent, and entertainment (represented from 1 to 5 respectively). She has the budget allocations for two months, each stored in a dictionary where keys represent categories and values represent the amounts allocated. 



Shruthi wants to combine these two budgets into one. If a category appears in both months, the total allocation for that category should be the sum of the amounts from both months.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of categories in the first month's budget.

The next n pairs of lines represent the first month's budget, where each pair consists of:

An integer representing the category.
An integer representing the amount allocated to that category.
The next line consists of an integer m, representing the number of categories in the second month's budget.

The next m pairs of lines represent the second month's budget, where each pair consists of:

An integer representing the category.
An integer representing the amount allocated to that category.
Output format :
The output displays "Merged Budget" followed by a dictionary representing the merged budget, where the keys are the categories and the values are the total amounts allocated."""
